                <p>"I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and
                    have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
                    found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 successfully switched careers,
                    working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.</p>
