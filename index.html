                <p>"I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and
                    have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
                    found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 successfully switched careers,
                    working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.</p>

                <h3>Such a life-changing experience. Higly recommended!</h3>
                <p>"Before joining the bootcamp, i've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
                    professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
                    student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entirew curriculum and
                    staff did not disappoint. The were very hand-os and i never had to wait long for assistance. The
                    agile team projec, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way
                    that no tutorial could ever have. In factr, i've often referred to it during interviews as an
                    example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer
                    after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"

                <h3>Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and
                    learning from their experiences was easy.</h3>
                <p>"The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress wich i find refreshing. The program gave me the
                    confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior
                    developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an
